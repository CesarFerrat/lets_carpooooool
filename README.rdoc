Result: Awarded the "Most Technically Complex Project" during the IronHack Hackshow Aug. 7th 2015 in Miami.  http://lets-carpooooool.herokuapp.com
After working 9 days on the project, I presented a technical solution to improve Car Pooling platforms by bringing more accuracy so more matches between drivers and riders = more business $$. Currently the car polling world leader BlaBlaCar (worth $1+ billion) is missing a lot of matches.

Using the Google Maps API, I created a technical solution in order to find all the cities present between a point A and point B anywhere in the world.
This solution can be applied to many other activities/business.
